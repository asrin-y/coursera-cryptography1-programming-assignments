# Programming Assignments' Solutions of [Cryptography I Course by Dan Boneh](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto)

## Summaries of each weeks assignments:
1. Decrypt messages which are encrypted by a stream cipher using the same key
2. Implementation of AES-CBC(cipher-block chaining) and AES-CTR(counter) modes using AES-ECB(electronic codebook)
3. Using HMAC(SHA256) to generate a stream of blocks that has the HMAC of next block provide integrity for large files while downloading byte by byte.
4. Padding oracle attack in AES-CBC
